<p>Shortly after sunset the express train, speeding north from Naples,
emerges from the mountains and begins winding its way down
grade. The expectant visitor to the Eternal City sees below him
through the car window a broad expanse of plain, sloping imperceptibly
on the left to the sea, in front to the Tiber River. It is an ocean of green,
here quietly level, there billowed in ridges or headed up in round hillocks.</p>

<p class="caption">EMPEROR CLAUDIUS</p>

</div>

<p>This is the Campagna, the broad flat belt which borders the Tiber
on the left. At first sight it reveals to us its solitude. In early Roman
times it had swarmed with peasants who owned the lands they tilled. As
the city grew wealthy the district fell into the hands of lords, who covered
it with their luxurious villas, peopled by multitudes of slaves. Still
later, when Rome was declining, these villas fell to ruins, the slaves disappeared,
and Malaria stalked lonely and terrible over the beautiful
country she had made her own. Even now she rules it, scarcely weakened
by modern progress. The dwellings of her few wretched tenants
are miles apart. Herds of sheep and of fierce long-horned cattle pasture
on the abundant grass, and along the well-made roads that span the
plain an occasional ox-team wearily drags an awkward cart.</p>

<p class="caption">THE TEMPLE OF CASTOR AND POLLUX</p>

<p class="caption">The ruins of this famous temple stand in
the Forum.</p>

</div>

<p>But the Campagna has its attractions. It fascinates imaginative
tourists and draws them to its heart. Three or four together, their
knapsacks filled with food and drink, often take long trips through this
wild region, whose eternal quiet speaks peace to the weary mind, whose
delicate, ever-changing tints of sky and field appeal to the taste for natural
beauty, whose ruined villas and towns awaken
historical memories of the rise of Rome from
a little settlement on the Tiber to a worldwide
power and a fame that cannot die.</p>

<h3>THE APPIAN WAY</h3>

<p>The most impressive features of the
Campagna as we view it from the car window
or in a stroll along either the old Appian
Way or the modern Appian Way, are the
ruins of aqueducts. The one here illustrated
is the Claudia, named after Emperor
Claudius, who completed it. Its sources
were more than forty miles distant; while
crossing the Campagna the water flowed in
a channel supported by a series of gigantic
arches. It provided Rome not only with
her best water, but her most abundant
supply, amounting to more than 400,000 cubic meters daily. All the
aqueducts together poured into the city each day more fresh water than
the Tiber now empties into the sea.</p>

<p>As we view this work of great utility,
we naturally wonder what sort of
man was the builder. At the time of
his accession he was fifty years old,
and had devoted his earlier life zealously
to study and writing. Grotesque
in manner and eccentric in his habits,
he was generally considered a learned
fool; and yet he made an admirable
ruler. When acting as judge he often
slept during the pleas of the lawyers,
waking at the close of the trial to give
his decision in an equitable and humane
spirit. It was unfortunate for the case,
however, if he chanced to smell anything
good cooking in a neighboring restaurant;
for he would adjourn court to
refresh himself. He was far more liberal
than his predecessors in bestowing
Roman citizenship on subject peoples.</p>

<p>To keep the city population supplied
with cheap food, he subsidized and
insured grain ships at the cost of the
government; and his activity in erecting public works is illustrated by
the completion of this magnificent aqueduct. It is a fact of great importance
that the early emperors, whatever their private characters,
almost uniformly devoted themselves to the public good. Personal service
to the empire was their chief title to office and the basis on which
successive rulers built up their power.</p>

<h3>THE FORUM</h3>

<p>The city of Rome itself abounds in places and objects of interest
more easily reached than the Campagna. It requires at least a teaspoonful
of information to appreciate the features of Rome; and to those who are
mentally equipped no spot furnishes keener enjoyment than the Forum.
An impressive view can be had looking eastward from the Capitol, one
of the “seven hills” on which the early city sat. It can be seen that
the Forum lies in a valley nearly surrounded by hills. In the tenth and
ninth centuries <span class="smcapuc">B. C.</span> these hilltops were occupied by villages and the valleys
between them were marshes. In the eighth century the villages
united to form one city,&mdash;Rome,&mdash;and the marshes were gradually drained
by means of sewers. The low area became at that time the Forum,
“marketplace” of the new city. It is an approximate oblong, on the
north side of which one of the kings marked off a space,&mdash;the comitium
(assembly-place),&mdash;in which all the citizens met to vote on questions of
public importance. Adjoining the comitium was the senate-house.
King (afterward two consuls), senate, and popular assembly constituted
the government. The Forum was therefore the political center of Rome,
and from this circumstance it derives all its interest. When one reflects
that for nearly five centuries after the downfall of the kings (509-27 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>)
Rome was a republic, that during that time she conquered and organized
in her empire practically the whole Mediterranean basin, we begin
to understand that this spot
must have been the scene of
stupendous political conflicts,
the birthplace of far-reaching
legislative and administrative
measures. Here worked the
brain of the best organized
and most enduring empire the
world has known.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus04.jpg" width="300" height="232" alt="" />

<p class="caption">CLOACA MAXIMA</p>

</div>

<p>An essential feature of the
Roman government was religion,
which the senate and
magistrates well knew how to
operate for practical ends. It
is not surprising, therefore, to
find about the Forum the
ruins of many temples. There
is the temple of Saturn, now only a group of columns. It rests on an
unusually high foundation. Within this basement were chambers which
contained the treasury of the state. It was largely by the control of
the treasury that the senate long maintained its political supremacy.</p>

<p>A few steps from the temple is the pavement of a great oblong building,
of whose superstructure there are but scant remains. This was the
Basilica Julia, erected by Julius Cæsar, and rebuilt, after a destructive
fire, by Augustus. A basilica was used for law courts and for business
purposes. The style of building was borrowed from Greece; but the
architect at Rome wrought in the spirit of her people. He left the exterior
plain and unattractive, to devote his whole attention to the interior.
It is essentially a vast hall, with aisles separated from nave by a row of
arched piers in this case, in other basilicas by colonnades. The designer
molded, as it were, the interior space, so as to express in the language
of art the grandeur of the empire, and in the severe harmony of the lines
the orderliness and symmetry of Roman law. No other architectural type
so well embodied the imperial idea.</p>

<p>Of the other buildings connected with the Forum the most conspicuous
is the temple of Castor and Pollux, just beyond the Basilica Julia.
The ruins consist of three
slender columns, standing on
a high foundation and supporting
a fragment of the
entablature. These remains
belong to the reconstruction
of the temple under Augustus.
The worship of the twin gods,
Castor and Pollux, patrons of
cavalry, had been introduced
from Greece into Rome in
the early republic. The front
porch of the temple often
served as a platform for party
leaders while addressing the
crowd in the Forum. On such
occasions it sometimes became the center of violent political conflicts out
of keeping with the beauty of the surroundings. This temple and nearly
all others at Rome are of the Corinthian order of architecture, distinguished
by the capital of clustered acanthus leaves surmounting the
graceful fluted column. It is one of the best of its class; and the three
columns with their entablature form the most beautiful architectural
fragment still preserved from classical Rome.</p>

<p class="caption">EMPEROR TITUS</p>

</div>

<p>The present level of the Forum is many feet lower than that of its
immediate surroundings. During the three thousand years that separate
us from the beginnings of the city the valleys have been gradually filling
through the accumulation of debris of ruined
buildings, the washings of earth from the surrounding
hills, and various other means. Recently
scholars have excavated nearly the whole Forum
down to the earliest level, laying bare the lower
parts of buildings, the earlier pavements, altars,
a primeval cemetery, and many other objects.
Nearly everything found has been identified and
clothed in the historical imagination with the
associations of the time when it had a purpose
and a meaning. But the spot, once the abode of
intense life, is now still; it seems the burial place
of a dead society and government; state officials
keep drowsy guard over the remains. Tourist and
scholar walk undisturbed through this sepulcher
of a mighty empire, their senses awakened to the
ancient life only by the rush of waters through
the subterranean Cloaca Maxima, and to the life
of our day by the roses,
geraniums, and wild Italian
flowers that grow luxuriantly
wherever a bit of soil is left.</p>

<h3>THE ARCH OF TITUS</h3>

<p>Beyond the Forum and
on the summit of the ridge
known as the Velia is the Arch
of Titus. We can read the inscription:
SENATUS POPULUSQUE
ROMANUS DIVO
TITO DIVI VESPASIANI
F. VESPASIANO AUGUSTO
(The senate and people of
Rome (dedicated this arch) to
the deified Titus Vespasianus Augustus, son of the deified Vespasianus.)
Consider this inscription. Both the Greeks and the Romans propitiated
the spirits of the dead with sacrifice and prayer. The founder
of a city or any specially great benefactor of the community they
venerated after death as a hero, a being intermediate in dignity and
power between man and the gods.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus06.jpg" width="300" height="227" alt="" />

<p class="caption">THE COLOSSEUM FROM THE NORTH</p>

</div>

<p>It was with this idea that the senate by decree deified (more strictly,
heroized) a deceased emperor who seemed to that body to have been a
specially worthy ruler. Thus they had deified Vespasian, and after him
his son and successor Titus. This arch, therefore, was dedicated by the
senate and people to the memory of Emperor Titus after his death.
A monument of the kind commemorated a victory so great as to entitle
the general to a triumph,&mdash;a procession of the victorious commander
and his army along the Sacred Way, past the Forum, and up
the Capitol to the temple of Jupiter on the summit. The spoils of war
were carried in the procession, while games and other festivities rejoiced
the hearts of the populace.</p>

<p>This arch is a memorial of the war waged by Titus against the Jews,
in which he besieged and destroyed Jerusalem, their holy city. During
the conflict the Jews resisted with superhuman energy; and when everything
was lost they killed one another and their wives and children
as the lot determined, in order not to be slaves. The fame of their
heroism is as imperishable as the military renown of the conqueror.
The triumphal arch, accordingly, represents the slaughter of innocent
people, the crushing of national liberty, the brutal sacking of cities, the
merciless sale of captives into slavery. While casting this gloomy shadow,
it reflects on the sunlit side the glory of victory and the extension and
solidification of Roman power.</p>

<h3>THE COLOSSEUM</h3>

<p>This immense amphitheater was built by Vespasian and dedicated
by Titus. It is a gigantic oval four stories in height. From the north
side, which is still nearly intact, the first three stories present simply a
series of arcades; the fourth story is a closed wall. Four entrances lead
into the arena; seventy-six others into vaulted corridors, whence the spectators
passed up various stairways to their seats, which extended in tiers
from near the floor to the top of the highest story. The seats have disappeared,
but careful measurement places the capacity at 45,000, with
standing room for perhaps 5,000 more. Hidden from view were the cages
of wild beasts and the cells for gladiators, and beneath the arena were
machines for elevating animals to the surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/illus07.jpg" width="500" height="342" alt="" />

<p class="caption">INTERIOR OF THE COLOSSEUM ON A FÊTE DAY</p>

</div>

<p>The dedication in 80 <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> was accompanied with games lasting through
a hundred days. A Roman “game” involved a contest; and those offered
by Titus at the dedication included the baiting and slaughter of savage
beasts, fights of gladiators, and a sham naval battle, the arena being flooded
for the purpose. It is difficult to understand how a ruler such as Titus,
who abhorred bloodshed and would condemn no man to death during his
administration, provided the city populace with this bloody, brutalizing
sport. But love of popularity has always been a powerful motive among
men; and some emperors and patriotic citizens tried to excuse the sport on
the foolish supposition that it fostered the military spirit. As a matter of
fact, the populace who attended these shows grew more and more unwilling
and unfit to defend their country and homes against invading barbarians.</p>

JULIA</p>

<p class="caption">A drawing showing

Forum.</p>

</div>

<p>It was not till some years after Titus that the spectators began to
experience a new kind of pleasure in seeing Christians thrown living to
the wild beasts of the arena. Many thus perished as witnesses of a better
faith and a higher morality. When, however, Christianity triumphed
and became the religion of the empire, an effort was instituted, first by
Constantine, to stop the degrading shows. But the people were so frantically
addicted to them that they were scarcely abated by government
edicts till Emperor Honorius succeeded in abolishing gladiatorial
fights in 404. Long afterward the hunting of wild beasts continued.
The massive structure remained scarcely impaired by time till about
the middle of the fourteenth century, when the greater part of the
southern half collapsed, probably through an earthquake. The ruin
piled up a “mountain of stone,” which for the next five centuries served
the Roman nobles as a quarry.</p>

<h3>THE GRANDEUR OF THE COLOSSEUM</h3>

<p>Some of the most imposing palaces which lend dignity to the modern
city have been built with this material. Although fully half the stone has
been thus removed, the part of the structure which still remains is the
most impressive of all the ruins of the city&mdash;a monument of the grandeur
and of the moral degradation of Rome. It is an especially rich experience
to visit the Colosseum by moonlight, where, seated on a stone at the edge
of the arena, we may in imagination, with the aid of the tranquil light,
reconstruct the vast interior and repeople it with a Roman multitude
breathlessly awaiting the opening of the games or exulting over the triumph
of a popular favorite. On certain nights the municipal authorities
illuminate the interior with colored lights, whose weird spell awakens
the imagination to sights of bloody conflict amid a yelling, savage mob.</p>

<h3>THE TOMB OF HADRIAN</h3>

<p>The most versatile and perhaps the ablest of all the emperors&mdash;an
artist, poet, philosopher, general, and statesman&mdash;- was Hadrian. Two-thirds
of his reign of twenty-one years (117-138 <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span>) he devoted to
travel throughout his vast empire. The object of these journeys was
not, like that of our presidents, to explain policies and secure votes for
reëlection to a second term; for the emperor’s lease of power was
lifelong. His purpose was rather to discover and meet the needs
of his people. We find him accordingly improving the organization,
equipments, and discipline of the army, fortifying exposed points of
the frontier, negotiating treaties of alliance with border states,
building roads, providing the cities he visited with temples, theaters,
and aqueducts, carefully overseeing the complex system of administrative
officers, or finding relaxation in conversation with architects,
authors, and philosophers.</p>

<p>In the period of the decline the tomb was converted into a
fortress, and this character it has retained to the present day. During
the Middle Ages and early modern times, a period of fifteen hundred
years, it was the center of nearly all the factional strife and of
the civil and foreign wars that raged in and
about the city. During this time it experienced
the greatest changes in appearance by
the removal of decorations and facings and
the substitution of ramparts, turrets, and
other elements of military defense.</p>

<p>Its present name, Castle of Sant’ Angelo,
was given it in the time of Pope Gregory the
Great. The story is told that in 590, when
leading a procession to Saint Peter’s in an
attempt to check by prayer a dreadful pestilence,
“as he was crossing the bridge, even
while the people were falling dead around
him, he looked up at the mausoleum and
saw an angel on its summit, sheathing a
bloody sword, while a choir of angels around
chanted with celestial voices the anthem since
adopted by the Church in her vesper service.”
In commemoration of the miracle a statue of the Holy Angel Michael
stands on the summit with wings outspread.</p>

<p>This castle unites the memories of nearly two thousand past years
with the living present. Having stood as a fitting tomb of a noble
emperor, and again as the storm center of divisional strife, let it
bide henceforth as a durable monument of Italian unity and freedom.</p>

<h2><i>Editorial</i></h2>

<p>The present number of The Mentor is
the last of the calendar year&mdash;not that of
The Mentor year, for that will end in
February next. The turn of the calendar
year, however, brings with it the inevitable
moment of retrospection. This is
merely a habit of the human mind, for the
New Year is only a human establishment.
In a sense it may be said that every day
is the beginning of a new year and the
ending of an old year. The real new year
for a human being, it seems to us, begins
with his birthday, for that is the beginning
of all things for him. Our new year will
begin with the number of The Mentor on
which we print for the first time Volume
II&mdash;and that will be next February. But,
indulging for a moment in the mood of
retrospection that the season brings, we
look back to that day last February when
we sent out the first number of The Mentor
to our readers. We had readers even
then, for the mere announcement of the
publication brought a gratifying response.
Many thousands, attracted by the plan,
invited The Mentor to their homes before
the first number had been printed.</p>

</div>

<p>We thank these early readers, for they
showed us that there was a public ready
for The Mentor. These first friends have
stayed by us from the beginning, and we
hope that during the months gone by we
have gained in their esteem. Their number
has been many times doubled since
our first number appeared, but our hearts
are warm toward them, for they took our
word for the plan before we had any publication
to show. And it means a great
deal to us to note that they have stayed
with us through the weeks of our growth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>It means, too, a great deal in a practical
way to us, for it shows that the interest in
The Mentor plan is an enduring one.
There has been so much enthusiasm over
some of the beautiful gravure pictures
that it was only natural to speculate at
times as to the motive that impelled some
to subscribe. We know now to our own
great satisfaction that it is not simply a
picture-loving public that takes The Mentor.
The serious interest in the subjects
that we have published, the earnest desire
to know what subjects would be forthcoming,
the intelligent suggestions that
we receive concerning various subjects
that might be included in The Mentor
plan&mdash;all these, and then the numerous
evidences in our mail that The Mentor is
bringing something new into the home
life, convince us that when we shaped our
plans on the broad lines of a comprehensive,
popular education we builded well.</p>

<p>This is the season for resolutions. We
registered our resolution when we founded
The Mentor Association. We could only
re-affirm it now. So, at the turn of the
year, instead of a resolution, we offer a
promise. We will give during the year of
1914 a full measure of the interesting matter
that has made friends for The Mentor
in the past&mdash;and we will give more. We
will add to the wealth of information that
we have supplied in the fields of history,
art, literature, travel, and science,&mdash;and
we will broaden our scope so as to include
articles that will be helpful as well as
instructive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>We mean to make every number count
in value and in interest. Our wish is that
each member of our Association shall say,
on laying down a number of The Mentor,
that he is richer in the knowledge that
cultivates or in the information that is
helpful, and that he has at all times been
interested and entertained.</p>

profit and progress to the members of The
Mentor Association!</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Roman Campagna was the cradle of a mighty
race. How did the little handful of men who
founded Rome, and their descendants, become masters
of the world? Livy, the great Roman historian,
believes it was due to the location of the city of Rome. “Not
without reason,” he says, “did gods and men choose this site
for Rome: healthy hills, a river equally
adapted for inland and maritime trade,
the sea not too far distant, … a site in
the middle of the Peninsula, made, as it
were, on purpose to allow Rome to become
the greatest city in the world.”</p>

<p>However healthy the climate of the
Campagna may have been in those times,
today it is about the most unhealthy in
the world. It is a district containing a
great many closed valleys and depressions
in the soil, without outlet for the waters
that accumulate. Natural watercourses
are impeded: Under the top soil are marl
and stiff clay, which hold the water after
it has filtered through the soil, and let it
ooze out to the lower parts of the country,
where it is mixed with rotting vegetable
matter. Barriers of hills prevent movement
of the air. Malaria runs rampant.</p>

<p>But this could not have been so formerly.
In the early history of the Campagna
towns were scattered over its surface.
Later these towns disappeared, and
the great estates, worked by crowds of
slaves, occupied the land. Then the great
villas, whose ruins now strew the ground
everywhere in the neighborhood of Rome,
were built. The ancient Roman nobility
lived in great numbers in the very places
now found so deadly. Their summer
homes were placed not only on the sea-shore,
but all through the country.</p>

<p>Huge aqueducts supplied Rome with
water and irrigated the farms on the Campagna.
These are the most conspicuous
ruins on the Campagna today. The
Gothic army at the siege of Rome in 536
destroyed nearly all the aqueducts, and
later on the great country seats were
demolished.</p>

<p>Six miles from Rome on the Flaminian
Road, at the spot now called the Prima
Porta, Empress Livia had a country
house, which has been excavated. It was
well decorated and comfortable. There
were found in the house a statue of Emperor
Augustus and the busts of several
members of the royal family.</p>

<p>The ruins of many tombs are found on
the Campagna. Roman family vaults contained
a funeral banquet hall, on a level
with the road, and a crypt below, where
the ashes were kept in urns, or the bodies
laid to rest in sarcophagi.</p>

<p>The sites of the cities of Veii, Fidenæ,
and Gabii, once the rivals and equals of
Rome, are now almost deserted. In sea-coast
towns of Ardea, Laurentum, Lavinium,
and Ostia, at one time well populated,
are practically empty. The inhabitants
are haggard and fever stricken. The children
are gaunt, hollow cheeked, and sallow
in complexion. Men who work there in
the fields fear to pass the night in the country
because of the fever. They return to
Rome every evening. Forsaken towers
and buildings, which stand rotting everywhere
about the Campagna, tell the same
story of a pestilence-stricken district. Now
for the most part only foxes, bears, and
other wild animals tenant the ragged pastures
and wild jungles of the Campagna.</p>

<p class="dropcap">When Rome was founded by Romulus and his handful
of comrades they soon saw that if the city was
to grow and prosper they would need wives. How
to get them was the question. Near Rome was a
nation called the Sabines. So the Romans enticed the women
of this nation to the new city and kept them there. It is
recorded that these early Romans were
pretty fine looking men, and that the
efforts of the Sabine women to escape
were not very strenuous.</p>

<p>But naturally the Sabine men were not
pleased to be thus deprived of their wives.
They started a war with Rome, and besieged
the city.</p>

<p>The Capitoline Hill was the most important
of the seven hills on which Rome was
built. So Romulus fortified it strongly,
and gave it into the care of one of his
bravest generals, Tarpeius. But Romulus
reckoned without Tarpeia, the daughter
of Tarpeius.</p>

<p>The Sabine men had a custom of wearing
heavy gold and silver bracelets on
their left arms. Tarpeia saw these and
was dazzled by them. She planned to get
possession of them all. One night she
crept down to the gate and promised the
leader of the Sabines that she would open
it and give up the hill to them, if they
would give her what they wore on their
left arms.</p>

<p>The Sabines agreed to this, and Tarpeia
opened the gate. The Sabines seem to
have been brave, honorable men, and although
they believed all was fair in war,
yet they hated a traitor. Besides the
bracelets they carried their shields on
their left arms; so they kept their promise
to Tarpeia by throwing these shields on the
girl and crushing her to death.</p>

<p>The hill was afterward spoken of as
“Mons Tarpeius,” meaning the “Hill of
Tarpeia.” It was after this traitorous girl
also that the rock from which traitors
were hurled was named the “Tarpeian
Rock.”</p>

<p>The Sabines held Capitoline Hill for a
time; but finally decided to unite with the
Romans, and the women were divided between
the two nations by lot.</p>

<p>The Capitol was in reality that part of
Capitoline Hill occupied by the Temple of
Jupiter; but included the Piazza del
Campidoglio, with the palaces that face it
on three sides. In this depression was
situated the “Asylum” of Romulus. In
the early days of Rome the founders
wished to attract people to settle there,
and they issued invitations to all neighboring
cities; but not many accepted. So
Romulus conceived the brilliant idea of
receiving all fugitives from other towns as
citizens of Rome and guaranteeing them
protection. For this purpose he converted
the depression in Capitoline Hill into a
place of refuge, or “Asylum.” In this way
the new city was peopled.</p>

<p>Capitoline Hill has been the scene of
many historical events. In 1251, during
the senatorship of Brancaleone, who destroyed
140 private castles in Rome, the
Capitol was besieged and taken by the
partizans of the pope and the nobility.
Petrarch was crowned poet laureate there
in 1341.</p>

<p>The entire Capitoline Hill is undermined
with large and excessive artificial
caverns. These caverns are apparently
ancient and mostly the work of medieval
quarry men.</p>

<p class="dropcap">So many statues crowded the streets of the Forum at
one time that Rome was said to have two equal
populations, one in flesh and blood, the other in
bronze and marble. This was almost literally true.
The Forum was the center of Rome. It was the political and
business meeting ground of the citizens. Situated in the valley
between the seven hills of the city, it was
the common property of the people of all
the hills. So when anyone wanted to
erect a statue or a gallows, a temple or a
shop, he put it in the Forum. Naturally,
the Forum became overcrowded.</p>

<p>The Forum Romanum was in the shape
of an oblong, 690 feet long and 240 feet
wide. It does not seem to be this large,
however, since the space is so taken up by
monuments.</p>

<p>In the beginning the Forum was the
marshy battlefield of the early inhabitants
of the Capitoline and Palatine Hills.
When the ground was drained by great
ditches it became under a united rule the
most convenient place for political meetings,
for business affairs, for the pageants
of rich men’s funerals, for plays, and for
gladiatorial games. For these purposes a
central space, though but a small one was
kept clear of buildings. Gradually even
this space became filled with the ever
growing crowd of statues and other honorary
monuments.</p>

<p>Awnings were probably spread over this
central space of the Forum, since square
holes are found in the pavement which
held masts on which the awnings could be
suspended. Beneath the pavement also a
network of passages was discovered. These
passages were three feet below the surface,
and eight feet high and five wide. They
were probably used for scenic purposes
when games and plays were given in the
Forum.</p>

<p>The rostra stood in the Forum. This
was a platform from which speakers addressed
the people. It was decorated
with the prows of captured ships. Thus,
the platform was called the rostra, or
beaks.</p>

<p>There is a story that one night in 362
<span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> a monstrous chasm opened in the
Forum. The Romans were dumbfounded.
The chasm must be closed before business
could go on. The oracles said that the
gulf would never close until Rome’s most
valuable possession had been thrown into
it. What was the most valuable possession
of Rome? Some said one thing, some
another. Then Marcus Curtius, a young
man of noble family, announcing that
nothing was more precious to Rome than
her sons, leaped fully armed and on horseback
into the chasm. The gulf closed immediately.
Later the spot was covered
by a marsh called Lake Curtius, and later
still when the marsh had been drained, an
inclosed space containing an altar marked
the place.</p>

<p>Once the center of the civilized world,
the heart of the Roman empire, the
Forum is now but a mass of crumbling
ruins; and the walls that long ago looked
down upon streets crowded with the
rulers of the world now see only the occasional
tourist.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Thus ran the ancient prophecy made by two English
pilgrims to Rome in the eighth century. And
although only about one-third of the original Colosseum
is left, Rome still stands; not in its former
power and majesty, however. The Colosseum is the amphitheater
where the Romans held gladiatorial fights. Later they
added to the program the slaughter of
Christians by wild beasts. A lion or tiger
was starved for a week or so, and then
turned loose on a crowd of naked Christians
in the arena. These spectacles were
a source of great amusement to the
Romans.</p>

<p>Fifty thousand people could be seated in
the Colosseum. The lowest seats were the
most honorable, the upper galleries being
occupied by the lower classes, where the
seats were often free. An awning was
stretched over the seats, and to provide
further for the comfort of the audience
jets of water cooled the air, and fragrant
perfumes scented it.</p>

<p>The Colosseum was oval in shape, and
had four tiers of seats, surrounding the
arena. Arena means sand in Latin, and
as the place where the contests took place
was covered with sand to keep the gladiators
from slipping in the blood, so it received
this name. The arena is about
94 yards long by 54 yards wide. The
podium&mdash;which was long ago removed&mdash;was
a raised platform 12 feet high at
the base of the seats, on which sat the
emperor, the senators, and the vestal virgins.
Each person on the platform had a
thronelike seat. The emperor’s was
raised above the others, and had a canopy
over it.</p>

<p>When the Colosseum was dedicated in
80 <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> by Emperor Titus there was a
celebration that lasted almost one hundred
days. Five thousand wild animals
were slaughtered in the arena.</p>

<p>Before the Colosseum was built the
gladiatorial contests were held in the Forum.
Vespasian began the construction
of the amphitheater in 72 <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> The Flavian
Amphitheater was the name first given
to the building, from the family name,
Flavium, of the emperors who built it.</p>

<p>Earthquakes destroyed the arena and
podium in 442 and 580; but it was not
until the reign of Justinian in the sixth
century that the shedding of human blood
ended. A bull fight was held in the building
as late as 1332.</p>

<p>The Roman popes and princes used the
Colosseum as a place from which to get
building material. These barbarous nobles
of the Middle Ages treated this historic
building shamefully.</p>

<p>Passion Plays were given in the Colosseum
in the seventeenth century. It was
used as a manufacturing place for saltpeter
in 1700. Half a century later Pope
Benedict XIV consecrated the building to
the memory of the Christian martyrs who
had died there.</p>

<p>The chief characteristics of the Colosseum
are strength and solidity. The historic
memories that cluster round its walls,
of mighty emperors and blood-thirsty
mobs, of screams of death or triumph, of
gorgeous pageants and heroic martyrdom,
combine to render the Colosseum the
most imposing ruin in the whole world.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Through tiers of crowded seats that flanked their
line of march, Titus and Vespasian rode in their
triumphal procession in 70 <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> Jerusalem had
been conquered, and the Temple burned and
destroyed. This celebration was called the “Triumph,”
which was given by Rome to all her successful generals on
their return from campaigns. It had been
a hard task for Titus to conquer rebellious
Jerusalem. Oppression and extortion by
the Roman rulers had risen to such a
height that the Jews were driven at last
into desperate resistance to the overwhelming
power of Rome. Vespasian was
sent by Emperor Nero to subdue them.
All Galilee was soon subjugated, and only
Jerusalem remained unconquered.</p>

<p>When Vespasian returned to Rome and
became Emperor, he sent his son Titus to
subdue Jerusalem. Titus arrived upon
the heights near Jerusalem and began to
besiege the city. He captured the first and
second walls. Then he built a wall round
the city, and soon had it in a state of
famine.</p>

<p>At length all the city was captured but
the Temple. Here the Jews made their
last stand. Titus wished to save the
Temple; but his soldiers set fire to it and
plundered it. A terrible massacre of all
the inhabitants of Jerusalem followed.
Then the prisoners and spoils were borne
to Rome.</p>

<p>The next year Titus and Vespasian had
their Triumph. The Senate and other
chief men led the procession. Then came
the spoils, with persons bearing title boards
or placards, from which the spectators
might find out the history of all the objects
that passed before them. There were silver,
gold, and ivory in all kinds of forms,
gems set and unset, tapestries of the rarest
Babylonian embroidery; there were various
foreign animals dressed in gorgeous
trappings.</p>

<p>But what interested the spectators the
most was the large, high platforms, on
which were exhibited parts of the campaign,&mdash;models
of cities, temples, fortresses,
assaulted, captured, in ruins or in
flames, representations of the hostile
armies in all the different forms of war.
Then came the models of captured ships.
Priests with bulls for sacrifice followed.</p>

<p>Seven hundred Hebrew youths as prisoners
marched next. Then came the spoils
from the Temple of Jerusalem,&mdash;the
Golden Table, the Golden Candlestick, and
last of all the Book of the Law.</p>

<p>Emperor Vespasian, followed by Titus,
each in a separate chariot, rode next in
the procession, with Domitian, who was
the younger son of Vespasian, and consul,
on horseback. After them came the
soldiers who had been in the war, crowned
with laurel leaves and shouting songs of
victory. Thus the triumphal procession
went along the Sacred Way.</p>

<p>When they came to the Temple, Simon,
the general of the Hebrews, was put to
death, according to custom. The leader
of the conquered army was always killed
at the Triumph of the conquering general.
The other prisoners were made either
gladiators or slaves. After Simon had
been put to death sacrifices were offered to
the gods, and all departed to the waiting
banquets.</p>

<p>The Arch of Titus was built on the Sacred
Way to commemorate this Triumph.
It was one of the earliest of those twenty-one
arches with which Rome was once
adorned. The exact date of erection is not
known; but it must have been after the
death of Titus, for on the ceiling of the
vault of the arch Titus is represented as
sitting astride an eagle. At the funeral of
a Roman emperor an eagle was released,
on whose back the soul of the emperor
was supposed to mount to Heaven, there
to dwell among the gods forever.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Emperor Hadrian was a great traveler. He
spent the eight years from 119 to 127 <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> in
journeying round the Roman empire just to get
acquainted with the state of the provinces. When
he was in England he built the famous wall that extends
from the Solway to the Tyne. He fully deserved the title
“Father of his Country” which was given
him on his return to Rome.</p>

<p>Hadrian was also a famous builder.
In addition to the great Roman Wall
in England he erected many beautiful
and expensive structures in Athens,
and a villa at Tivoli which was noted
for its beauty. But his most famous
building is Hadrian’s Tomb, now called
Castle Sant’ Angelo, which was constructed
in 130 <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> The last vacant niche in the
Tomb of Augustus was occupied, and so
Hadrian determined to build one for himself
and his successors, which should have
no rival in the world. Hadrian died before
it was finished; but Antoninus Pius, his
successor, completed it and buried Hadrian
there.</p>

<p>“Hadrian’s Tomb” is a large circular
tower, 230 feet in diameter. It was originally
built of Parian marble. Some time
in the fifth century, however, it was converted
into a fort, and when the Goths
under Vitiges besieged it in 537 the defenders
tore the statues from their pedestals
and hurled them down upon the attackers.
Two of these were found during the seventeenth
century in the moat surrounding
the tomb.</p>

<p>In 590 there was a great plague in
Rome. Pope Gregory the Great was leading
a procession to Saint Peter’s Cathedral
to pray for deliverance from the pestilence,
when it is said the Destroying Angel appeared
on the summit of the Tomb of
Hadrian. The angel was sheathing his
sword to signify that the plague was
stopped. Since that time the building has
been known as the Castle Sant' Angelo.</p>

<p>In 610 Pope Boniface IV erected on the
summit of the tomb the Chapel of St.
Angelo inter Nubes in commemoration of
this event. Several statues of the Archangel
succeeded this. The present one was
put there in 1743.</p>

<p>Marozia, daughter of Theodora, held the
tomb as a fort in the tenth century, and
had Pope John X suffocated in a dungeon.
A few years later Pope Benedict VI met a
similar fate at the hands of Crescenzio, son
of Theodora.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the tenth century
Crescentius, the consul, had a quarrel
with the Pope and seized the fort. He
held it bravely against Emperor Otto III
who had marched into Rome in defense of
the pope.</p>

<p>Emperor Hadrian was an able military
leader, and a just and wise civil ruler.
His full name was Publius Ælius Hadrianus,
and he was born at Rome on
January 24, 76 <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> He was such an
ardent student of Greek that he was nicknamed
Græculus, the “Greek.” He served
in the campaign against the Dacians under
his uncle, Emperor Trajan. At the latter’s
death he became emperor. Hadrian
died at Baiæ on July 10, 138. His remains
were carried to Puteoli, from which place
they were afterward taken to Rome.</p>
